Fourteen years ago, on January 12, 2011, my life changed forever when I became a victim of unintentional gun violence. An intoxicated and negligent gun owner accidentally shot me, leaving me with a shattered femur, nerve damage and a severed femoral artery. As an avid marathon runner, critical care nurse and world traveler, the shooting suddenly robbed me of my physical autonomy where I faced immense physical pain, emotional trauma and financial hardship. 

In the weeks following, as I battled post-traumatic stress symptoms and struggled to envision a future where I could ever walk again, I held onto a longtime goal—running the NYC Marathon in 2011. It became my source of motivation, a light in the darkest moments of despair. I dedicated myself to healing in the hopes of running for victims of unintentional gun violence. However, as my recovery progressed, I faced the difficult reality that my injuries were too severe. I made the painful decision to give up running, unwilling to risk my renewed ability to walk. For 13 years, I believed I would never run again—so I didn't, up until now.

Recently, after caring for an 80-year-old patient who had completed nearly 400 marathons and ultramarathons, and after meeting a former Navy SEAL, I was reminded of the power of resilience and the human ability to push past limits to do the incredible. Inspired by their mindset and determination, I reconsidered what I thought was impossible and what it would take to accomplish my long-held dream of running the NYC Marathon.

With the support of running coaches, my growing running community, and my 8-year-old daughter, Macy, who joined me on my first walk-run—I discovered something incredible: **I can run again!**

Now that my passion and ability to run have been restored, I will fulfill my 14-year goal by running the NYC Marathon with March For Our Lives—the only sponsored charity dedicated to ending gun violence. It will be an honor to fundraise and run not only for myself, but also for the 46,000 lives lost each year to gun violence and to represent the 59,000 others left, lives forever changed.  

This is more than a race. This is my chance to reclaim my strength, to run for those who can't, to amplify the voices affected by gun violence, and to prove that even in the face of tragedy, hope and determination can carry us forward—one step at a time.
