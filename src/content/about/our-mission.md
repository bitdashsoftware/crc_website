# Empowering Women Through Trail Running

At Confluence Running Collective, our mission is to create a supportive, inclusive environment where women can discover the joy and empowerment of trail running. We believe that every woman deserves the opportunity to challenge herself, connect with nature, and build lasting friendships through the shared experience of running on beautiful trails.

Our women-only trail race is more than just a competition—it's a celebration of strength, resilience, and community. We're committed to breaking down barriers that have traditionally kept women from participating in trail running events, whether those barriers are physical, mental, or social.

## What We Stand For

- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming runners of all abilities, from first-time trail runners to experienced athletes
- **Support:** Creating a supportive environment where every participant feels encouraged and valued
- **Community:** Building lasting connections between women who share a passion for running and the outdoors
- **Empowerment:** Helping women discover their strength and capabilities through trail running
- **Environmental Stewardship:** Promoting responsible trail use and conservation

## Our Vision

We envision a world where trail running is accessible and welcoming to all women, regardless of their background, experience level, or physical abilities. Through our events and community initiatives, we hope to inspire more women to explore the trails, challenge their limits, and find their own path to personal growth and fulfillment.

By creating a women-only space for trail running, we're not excluding others—we're creating a safe, supportive environment where women can focus on their own journey without the pressures and dynamics that can sometimes exist in mixed-gender running events.

## Join Us

Join us in June 2026 for our inaugural women's trail race! Whether you're a seasoned trail runner or just starting your journey, we welcome you to be part of this special event.
