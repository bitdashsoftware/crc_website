## Our Mission

The primary mission of Confluence Running Collective is to redefine running and endurance events by centering cis women, trans women and non-binary folks who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces—creating inclusive, welcoming environments that celebrate connection over competition. We embrace all backgrounds, body types, abilities and experience levels. We prioritize genuine connection, support and camaraderie over competition and pace. Recognizing that every runner's path is different, we celebrate the unique effort, growth and experience that each journey brings—not just the finish line.

## Join Our Ambassador Team

We would love to partner with you to reach more communities of runners who would be interested in participating in our events! We are seeking a team of ambassadors to be liaisons between Confluence Running Collective and the communities you are already a part of. This free program is open for anyone to apply to—we have a few requests for you, and in return, you will get some pretty great perks too! Our terms last for one year. New ambassadors will be selected annually for the next season.
