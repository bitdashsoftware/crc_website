## Mission Statement

Our mission is to redefine running and endurance events by centering women – both trans and cis – women and non-binary folks who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces—creating inclusive, welcoming environments that celebrate connection over competition.

## Core Values

### Inclusion
We actively welcome those who find community in women-centered spaces, including cis women, trans women and non-binary folks across the gender spectrum—embracing all backgrounds, body types, abilities and experience levels.

### Community
We prioritize genuine connection, support and camaraderie over competition and pace.

### Honoring Every Journey
We recognize that every runner's path is different, and we celebrate the unique effort, growth and experience that each journey brings, not just the finish line. 

### Empowerment & Collaboration
We intentionally partner with women-owned businesses and vendors to amplify their talents and foster strength within both the running and event industries.

### Accessibility
We strive to reduce physical, financial and emotional barriers to participation, making our events welcoming for all.

### Integrity
We commit to thoughtful planning, transparent communication and intentional decision-making. 

## Purpose
Many endurance events have historically been created by—and let's be real, for—men. What's often missing is a true sense of shared accomplishment in the journey leading up to the race. Too often, events focus on performance and proving something, instead of celebrating everything it took just to get there. That's why we exist: to create welcoming, low-pressure events that center community and connection for a broader demographic. Whether you're training for your first 5K or your fiftieth ultramarathon, you deserve a space that honors your effort, uplifts your story and reminds you that you belong—just as you are.
