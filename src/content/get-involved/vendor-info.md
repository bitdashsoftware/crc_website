# Our Commitment to Women-Owned Businesses

At Confluence Running Collective, we believe in uplifting and celebrating the incredible work of women. That includes not just the runners at our events, but also the talented women behind the scenes—those who make the experience possible through their businesses, services and creativity.

We strive to work with women-owned vendors and creators whenever possible—whether it's coffee and catering, wellness services, photography or event production. We see every partnership as an opportunity to support and spotlight women in business.

**If you are part of a women-owned business and would like to be involved in one of our events, we'd love to hear from you. Please reach out to us at info@confluencerunningcollective.com and tell us a bit about what you do.**
