# Confluence Running Collective / Women's Trail Collective at Lacamas Lake Sponsorship

Confluence Running Collective seeks to redefine running and endurance events by centering women, trans women, and non-binary folks who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces—creating inclusive, welcoming environments that celebrate connection over competition—embracing all backgrounds, body types, abilities, and experience levels.

We prioritize genuine connection, support, and camaraderie and recognize that every runner's path is different. By celebrating the unique effort, growth and experience that each journey brings- not just the finish line, we seek to reach many women who may not have felt comfortable in the running event space previously. We strive to reduce physical, financial and emotional barriers to participation, making our events welcoming for all.

It is our intention to partner with women-owned businesses and vendors to amplify women's talents and foster strength within both the running and event industries.

Next year's inaugural event will take place on June 28th, 2026 at Lacamas Lake Park in Camas, Washington. We will offer a 5k and a 10k where runners, walkers, and hikers are all invited to participate.

We are looking for companies to partner with and if you are interested in becoming a sponsor for the Women's Trail Collective- at Lacamas Lake, please fill out the form below. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to: info@confluencerunningcollective.com
