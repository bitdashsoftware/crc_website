### **Purpose:**

</div>

Many endurance events have historically been created by—and let’s be real, for—men. What’s often missing is a true sense of shared accomplishment in the journey leading up to the race. Too often, events focus on performance and proving something, instead of celebrating everything it took just to get there. That’s why we exist: to create welcoming, low-pressure events that center community and connection for women. Whether you’re training for your first 5K or your fiftieth ultramarathon, you deserve a space that honors your effort, uplifts your story, and reminds you that you belong—just as you are.
