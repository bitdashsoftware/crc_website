My running journey started about two years ago after becoming a bereaved mama. I've been determined and have lost over 90 pounds via Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy. It has been my coping mechanism in grief and my escapeâ€”a form of therapy if you will.

My angel is my motivation and my hero. She inspires me daily and has guided me along this journey. I've been inspired by so many people along the way as well and hope to help someone with my story, and show them that they're not alone.
