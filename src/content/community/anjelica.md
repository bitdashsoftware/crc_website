My running journey began in 2014 when I started training for my very first half marathon. When my cousin invited me to join him and his friends run the OC Marathon that year, I thought it would just be a fun thing to cross off my bucket list. 

Little did I know just how much that first half marathon would change my life, in the best way possible, and kickstart the beginning of a special journey. In the past 11 years, half marathons turned into marathons and distances in between, which then turned into running my first trail race. Running has challenged me in ways I've never been challenged before: mentally, physically and emotionally. It's taught me the importance of consistency and that I'm capable of so much more than I ever imagined. But I think the most important thing running has given me is an incredible community consisting of some of the most supportive and encouraging individuals who have now become the greatest friends, turned family! Running truly brings people together and it's just one of the many reasons why I love the sport.
