Growing up, we didn't do much as a family. We weren't super well off, but my sisters ran Cross Country and Track. They didn't participate in any other sports. I remember running meets that would get our family out of the house, to go spectate, and treat at the concessions. I remember going with my mom to pick up my sisters from practice. They always seemed hot and sweaty, but in a better mood than when I last saw them.

I am not sure if my parents thought that I would run Cross Country or Track in school. I doubt that they thought that it would be any good for me because as a child I had asthma, hay fever, and, occasionally, pneumonia.

I don't remember how I was able to communicate that I wanted to do Cross Country, but I met some really good friends on the team. I outgrew asthma and other illnesses. I found a reason to be outside and have fresh air. I was shy and did not know how to comfortably talk to people, but once I started to run, I could speak more easily, be more comfortable in my own skin, and be free.

If I hadn't run in high school, I am not sure I would have liked going to school. Running still offers me opportunities to see new areas, discover places and things that I wouldn't have seen otherwise.

Running has always allowed me to get outside, get fresh air, and meet people. Some of my oldest friends I met while running. My newest friends generally come from meeting them while running as well.

It also helped me learn how to set goals and how to accomplish them. I love picking a destination and running to it. I love looking at results and analyzing, even if I may never win the race or my age category, or qualify for the more popular races. There are other reasons and races out there to enjoy. My running will not be diminished if I never qualify for Boston or complete a qualifying race in order to just enter the lottery for Western States.

Movement is something that I try not to take for granted. Sometimes when I am out running and struggling to breathe, generally not having a good time outside running, I see someone out with a walker or a different type of mobility aid, and it gives me a reason to keep going and not take running for granted. It makes me feel lighter and always makes my day feel better if I have gone for a run.
