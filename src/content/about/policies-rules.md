## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Our events celebrate and uplift women, trans women, and non-binary individuals who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces. We are deeply committed to fostering a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment that honors and supports people of all races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, sexual orientations, and backgrounds.

We specifically recognize and prioritize the voices and experiences of women and non-binary folks of color, understanding that systemic barriers and historic exclusion have impacted participation in endurance sports. Our events strive to create equitable access and representation by intentionally partnering with diverse vendors, offering financial assistance, and cultivating a community where all identities can thrive.

We believe that true inclusion requires ongoing listening, learning, and action to dismantle barriers and build a space where every participant feels valued, respected, and empowered.

## Trans-Women Participants

Our events are designed for women and those who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces. Participants are welcome to register based on their gender identity, and we honor each person's self-identification. No additional explanation is required.

## Non-Binary & Non-Conforming Participants

We welcome non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals who feel comfortable in women-centered spaces. Participants may choose to register in the women's or non-binary/open category, whichever aligns best with their identity.

## LGBTQIA+ Athletes

Our events affirm and celebrate LGBTQIA+ participants. We expect all participants to respect and support each other, helping maintain a welcoming atmosphere free from discrimination or harassment.

## Participants With Disabilities

We welcome participants of all abilities and are committed to making our events as inclusive and accessible as possible. However, due to the nature of trail terrain, some courses may present challenges or may not be fully suitable for certain mobility needs. We encourage participants to reach out to us in advance so we can discuss the course details and explore accommodations or alternative options to support a safe and positive race experience.

## First Organized Race Runners

We are proud to offer a *First Organized Race* category for those participating in their very first organized running or endurance race. This optional category allows new runners, walkers or hikers to be recognized and celebrated as a group, separate from traditional rankings. It's our way of honoring the courage, commitment, and personal milestones that come with showing up for the first time.

If you'd like to be included in this category, you may select this category option when you register online. Whether you run, walk, or hike your way to the finish, we're here to cheer you on every step of the way.

## Race Entry Assistance

Coming soon: We will be offering financial assistance to increase access to our events. Assistance will be awarded based on need and availability.

## Refund Policy

We offer refunds for race registrations **up to 120 days before the event**. After that point, we are unable to issue refunds.

This policy allows us to plan responsibly, factoring in what supplies need to be purchased, how many participants we're supporting, and what kind of infrastructure we'll need to ensure a safe, enjoyable event. It also helps us reduce waste and avoid unnecessary overordering of items like shirts, medals, and aid station supplies.

We appreciate your understanding and support in helping us create a thoughtful and sustainable event experience.

If you're unable to attend, please see our deferrals & **bib transfer** policy as an alternative option.

## Deferrals & Bib Transfer Policy

As a new company, we are excited to grow and host additional events in the future. While we don't yet have all the details finalized about upcoming races, we want to ensure flexibility and convenience for our participants. In the meantime, we are offering bib transfers to provide an immediate option for those who need to transfer their race entry. Looking ahead, we plan to expand this flexibility by offering race transfers as part of our evolving event services. This will allow participants to transfer their registration to another runner or to a future event, providing greater adaptability as we expand our race calendar. Our goal is to support our community every step of the way as we build a welcoming and dynamic series of events.

If you would like to transfer your bib to someone else who can run the race you're registered for but can no longer attend, please contact us at info@confluencerunningcollective.com. A $10 bib transfer fee will apply.

## Pregnancy Deferral Policy

Women who become pregnant after registering are eligible to defer their race entry. To initiate a pregnancy deferral, please contact us at [info@confluencerunningcollective.com](mailto:info@confluencerunningcollective.com) at any time before race day. No medical documentation is required-just let us know and we'll take care of the rest.

## Pregnancy Policy

Pregnant participants are welcome to race if they feel comfortable and have consulted with their healthcare provider. Safety and personal well-being are our top priorities.

## Changing Distances

Changing distances means switching to a different race length within the same event (for example, moving from a 10K to a 5K). This option is only available for events that offer two or more distances.

If you choose to move up to a longer distance, you will be responsible for paying the difference in registration cost. If you choose to move down to a shorter distance, no refunds will be issued for the difference.

## Event Cancellation/Reschedule Policy

If an event is canceled or rescheduled due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances, registrants will be notified promptly and offered options such as deferral or partial refunds at the discretion of event management.

## Timing Information

Timing is chip-based, and official results will be posted after the event.

## Youth Participation Policy

Participants under 18 require parental consent and may be subject to specific distance and safety guidelines.

## Shirt Exchanges

If you wish to change your shirt or other merchandise size from what you selected during registration, you may do so online up to **120 days** before the event. After this date, shirt exchanges cannot be guaranteed.

## Event/Race-Specific Rules

Please review specific rules for each race on the event website, including course conduct, aid station policies, and safety guidelines.
