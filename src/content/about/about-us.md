Having both worked in and competed at endurance events—many of which have been historically created by (and let’s be real- **for** men)—Both Tonya and Katie noticed something missing: a sense of shared accomplishment in the journey leading up to the event. Too often, races focus on performance and proving something, rather than celebrating everything it took just to get there.

Out of that belief, Confluence Running Collective was born: a women-led, women-centered space where events honor the effort, not just the outcome. Where the miles and the moments that come before race day matter just as much—if not more—than the finish line itself.

As part of this vision, our events aim to partner intentionally with women-owned businesses and vendors whenever possible, further reinforcing the strengths, talents, and capabilities of women in both the running and event spaces.

#### **Katie (she/her):**

Growing up with a college track long and triple jumper, turned coach, turned marathoner as a dad, Katie remembers traveling all over for track meets and going to many college and pro meets as a young child. She loved standing at the exit of the track getting all of the pro’s autographs! Katie’s dad started the first Hood to Coast team from the Seaside area when the Hood to Coast finish line was moved to Seaside. Katie followed in his footsteps starting the first high school Portland to Coast team at Seaside High going into her freshman year of high school, which is where she met Tonya! Their family has run the Hood to Coast about 20 times. 

Katie has been running since she can remember and ran her first 10k when she was 10. She still remembers reading in the newspaper that she won her age group! Growing up in a family of runners, running was just a normal and fun activity and when her dad got into marathoning, Katie often joined in on his training runs. She enjoyed cross country and track in middle and high school and then in graduate school ran her first half marathon.

Fast forward a few years and running is a very big part of Katie’s life today. She is a running coach, a run club founder, and now a race director. Katie founded a thriving running club and has great group of running friends that she loves to train and race with. Katie loves racing all distances but the marathon is her favorite at this time. Running the Wildwood trail end-to-end is one of her favorite running memories and something she hopes to continue to do annually. 

As a busy mom of two, Katie understands that running can be essential to so many women for self care for mental and physical health. She believes that anyone who runs is a runner and that should be celebrated!

#### **Tonya (she/her):**

One of Tonya’s earliest running memories was when her dad—who was also a cross country and track coach—told her that if she could run 11 miles, he’d buy her a pony. He assumed there was no way she’d make it. But 7-year-old Tonya, at the time deeply horse-obsessed, was determined to prove him wrong. She didn’t make it the full 11 miles, but she did manage 8—in white Keds shoes, the quintessential footwear for girls of the ’80s and ’90s.

Her feet were destroyed, but her spirit— even at seven years old—felt lifted. That early experience shaped the way Tonya has approached running ever since. It’s not always about achieving the goal you thought you were chasing; often, it’s about what you learn along the way and who you become through the effort. Running has always offered her lessons in perseverance, growth, and joy.

In middle and high school, Tonya ran cross country and track, and in her early twenties, she began training for half and full marathons. Already a lifelong swimmer, she eventually dove into triathlon as well, racing in several 70.3 races and a full Ironman. Today, she’s most passionate about long-distance trail running, with 50Ks and 50-milers under her belt, and her sights now set on 100- and 200-mile ultra distances.

Professionally, Tonya has spent nearly 20 years in the events industry, working on and or managing a wide range of events, including community bike rides, 5Ks and half-marathons, multi-day trail races, ultra-marathons, street fairs, corporate conferences, trade shows, incentive events, and yes, even weddings. For her, events are a lot like running: there’s an end goal, sure—but the meaning is found in the process.
