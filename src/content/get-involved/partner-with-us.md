At Confluence Running Collective, our mission is to create inclusive, supportive and joyful running experiences that center cis women, trans women, non-binary individuals and anyone who feels at home in a space built for women. If your group, organization or business shares those values, we’d love to connect.

## Ways to Partner

Whether you're part of a local running club, work in the event or race space, or simply have an idea for how we can support one another, let’s talk.

### Running Groups
Looking to get your community involved in a meaningful way? We’d love to highlight your group, host a joint event or create a shared experience that brings our communities together.

### Event Professionals & Creatives
Are you an event producer, timing company, brand rep, DJ, emcee, photographer, videographer or someone who brings magic to event day? We’re always looking to collaborate with women-led or women-supporting professionals to create events that are vibrant and welcoming.

### Let's Co-Create Something New 
Have a vision for a pop-up run, speaker panel, training series or community project? If it aligns with our mission and centers the running/wellness space for women and gender-diverse folks—we’re all ears.
