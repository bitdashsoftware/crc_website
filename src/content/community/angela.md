I started running a little over 10 years ago as a form of exercise. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with how running made me feel – strong, confident, and ready to take anything on. Although I have been running a long time, pace never mattered to me and being in competition with others was something that also didn't interest me. I simply wanted to encourage women to do hard things and show gratitude towards what our bodies can do, set goals and work towards them, to have fun and experience the joy and pride I felt after a run!

Throughout the years I have worked on pace and longer distance but my focus has remained the same – motivate women to show up for themselves every day.

An all-women's race creates a safe space for women to show up with fellow friends and accomplish something for themselves, without an added pressure of needing to look or perform a certain way and instead being able to focus on supporting and uplifting one another.
