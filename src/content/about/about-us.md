# Our Story

Confluence Running Collective was born from a simple yet powerful idea: women deserve their own space in the trail running community. Founded by a group of passionate female runners who experienced firsthand the transformative power of trail running, we came together to create something special for our community.

The name "Confluence" represents the coming together of different streamsâ€”just as rivers merge to form something greater, we believe that when women come together through running, we create something powerful and beautiful. Our collective represents the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and abilities that make our community so rich and vibrant.

## Our Founders

Our founding team brings together decades of combined experience in trail running, event organization, and community building. We're united by our shared passion for creating inclusive spaces where women can thrive and grow through the sport we love.

Each of us has experienced the unique challenges and joys of being a woman in the trail running world, and we're committed to using our experiences to create better opportunities for the next generation of female trail runners.
