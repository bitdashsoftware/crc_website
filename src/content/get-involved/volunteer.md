### **A Note About Volunteering**

In an effort to maintain the intentionally welcoming, women-centered environment of our events, we prioritize volunteer opportunities for cis women, trans women, non-binary individuals, and those who feel comfortable in a space centered on the experiences of women.

While we deeply value the support of all community members, we kindly ask that men refrain from volunteering at our events. This helps us create a space that feels safe, inclusive and supportive for our participants.

We appreciate your understanding and your support of our mission.
