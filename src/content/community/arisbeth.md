My running journey began as a simple escape, something just for me. I needed a break from the routine. At first, I ran for clarity. But as the miles added up, I started to uncover something deeper: a passion I had never been given the space to discover.

Growing up in a traditional Mexican household, sports were never part of my world. I watched my brothers play soccer while I was expected to head straight home from school—to clean, to help care for the house. I was never asked what I liked or if I wanted to try something different. Sports just didn't feel like they were an opportunity for me. It wasn't until I turned 24 that I laced up my running shoes and gave myself the chance to explore something new. For a long time, I ran alone. Then I started meeting other women—friends who, like me, found joy and purpose in early morning runs. We ran from 5Ks to long weekend miles, still never signing up for races, just running for the love of it.

One morning on the Wildwood Trail, during a fun trail run with three friends, the idea sparked. "What if we started a running club?" A space for women like us—who want to run but didn't know how to start or where to go? We talked and dreamed as we ran, and by the end of the run, we had a plan: we'd host our first group run on the first Saturday of May and see who showed up. We brainstormed names and finally landed on one that felt right: Latinas Running Club. It was who we were—four Latinas creating a space for women, by women. A run club rooted in culture, community and the courage to start something new.

On May 4 2024, Latinas Running Club (LRC) was officially established. LRC became the first Latina-run club in Washington County, created for all women seeking time for themselves. Since then, we've been running consistently every Wednesday and Saturday at 6:00 AM, followed by a coffee chat that gives us the chance to connect, unwind and build friendships bonded by a shared love for running. It's now been over a year. Many women have joined, some have stayed, others come and go, but what matters most is that we continue to show up for ourselves.

Running has encouraged other women to complete their first run, their first 5Ks, half marathons, and even full marathons. But more importantly, it has given us a beautiful, empowering community of women doing something we never imagined we could do.
